# DSSG2022
Data Science for Social Good fellowship at University of Washington's eScience Institute, Summer 2022

Here's a [project website](https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2022-Tracking-Poverty/) with more information.

You can also read an [article](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg-2022-minimum-wage) about the project and the team, or watch our [final presentation](https://youtu.be/rA6cTfoOFlU), which 20 minutes long. The slides are in the repo.

My colleague Zhaowen Guo and I gave a poster presentation at the Learning and Doing Data for Good Conference at UW in September 2022. The poster is in the repo.
